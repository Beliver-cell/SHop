I need you to fix my entire authentication system. Both admin login and normal user login are not working.
You must check EVERYTHING in my backend and frontend until it works 100%.
Do not skip any step.
Be strict and correct every mistake you see.

Fix ALL of the following:

Environment Variables

Verify all required env vars exist:
EMAIL_USER, EMAIL_PASS (App Password, not normal Gmail password),
EMAIL_HOST, EMAIL_PORT,
ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_PASSWORD,
JWT_SECRET,
FRONTEND_URL,
and any others my code expects.

Make sure the env variable names in .env exactly match the names in the code.

Make sure the Replit "Deploy" environment also contains these variables.

Email Verification

Fix the email sending logic.

Confirm it uses the correct env vars and correct SMTP configuration.

Make sure verification links contain the correct deployed backend URL.

Make sure verified users can log in.

Admin Account Logic

Add a backend script that automatically creates the admin account from ADMIN_EMAIL and ADMIN_PASSWORD if it does not exist.

Ensure the admin has role: "admin" and verified: true.

Login Logic

Fix normal user and admin login so it works without errors.

Make sure it handles:

email not found

wrong password

unverified accounts

admin vs normal user distinction

Ensure JWT is generated correctly.

Backend Errors

Fix any “configure your backend” or “missing config” messages.

Make sure no required variable or setting is missing.

Log clear errors if config is missing.

Frontend Connection

Ensure the frontend is using the correct API base URL.

Fix CORS issues.

Make sure login, register, verify, and admin login pages point to correct endpoints.

Deployment

Make sure both development and deployed environments use the same correct configuration.

Fix any build or deploy issues preventing auth from working online.

Final Deliverable:

Fix all code directly.

Create any missing files or scripts.

Output a report explaining:

what was broken,

what you fixed,

and what I need to update (like Gmail App Password).

Test admin login and normal login to confirm everything works.

Do not stop until authentication works perfectly.
